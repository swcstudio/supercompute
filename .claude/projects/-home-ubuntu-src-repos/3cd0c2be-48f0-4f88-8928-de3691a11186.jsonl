Running it on HP hardware would likely be a violation of the license as written. This means virtualization is only permitted on genuine Apple-branded hardware.\n\n### Virtual Machine Limits\nYou can \"install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is already running the Apple Software, for purposes of: (a) software development; (b) testing during software development; (c) using macOS Server; or (d) personal, non-commercial use\".\n\nOn each Mac, two additional virtual machines are permitted on top of the one directly installed. You will need to buy more Macs if you want to run additional virtual machines.\n\n### Service Bureau Restrictions\nThe grant \"does not permit you to use the virtualized copies or instances of the Apple Software in connection with service bureau, time-sharing, terminal sharing or other similar types of services\".\n\n## Big Sur Update for Cloud Hosting\n\nA significant change came with macOS Big Sur that addressed cloud hosting:\n\nThe update added an entirely new section to the software license agreement, bringing it up to 16 sections. This new section is called \"Leasing for Permitted Developer Services,\" and it makes people's jobs at companies like Macstadium much easier.\n\nKey provisions for cloud hosting include:\n- Apple software and hardware must be leased \"in its entirety to an individual or organization\"\n- A lease period must be \"for a minimum period of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours\"\n- Customers must now accept software agreements for all installed software of leased hardware\n- Developers may now \"install, use, and run additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments\"\n\n### Important Cloud Hosting Limitations\nOther hosting companies will try to slice up Macs, offering virtual macOS machines with lower specs to many customers at once. This is often what you get with Windows or Linux hosting companies but it's just not allowed with macOS. Not only does this take away from the performance experience Apple wants, but it is wise to remember that Apple is primarily a hardware company. They want to sell Macs. One customer to one machine.\n\n## Legal Considerations\nIt is not illegal to run macOS in a virtual machine, but it is in violation of the license agreement provided by Apple. As long as you obtain your copy of OSX legally it isn't illegal to run OSX in a virtual machine or even on non-Apple hardware. You will be violating Apple's EULA, but that isn't illegal.\n\n## Summary\nFor cloud hosting in 2025, macOS virtualization is permitted only on Apple hardware, with specific provisions for leasing entire Mac machines to customers for minimum 24-hour periods. Each Mac can run up to two additional virtual machines. The Big Sur update legitimized cloud hosting services like MacStadium by adding explicit leasing terms for developer services, but still prohibits slicing up Macs to serve multiple customers simultaneously."}]},"uuid":"9d8ffb07-7ee4-43a9-bd07-68a74a3803a7","timestamp":"2025-08-31T10:17:45.982Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Apple macOS virtualization licensing EULA requirements cloud hosting 2025","results":["I'll search for information about Apple macOS virtualization licensing EULA requirements for cloud hosting in 2025.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01JQ2ULhECF2ZhSU26GAvKgU","content":[{"title":"macos - Licensing around running VMWare ESX on a mac mini hosting multiple OS X guests - Ask Different","url":"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/135457/licensing-around-running-vmware-esx-on-a-mac-mini-hosting-multiple-os-x-guests"},{"title":"macOS EULA licensing restrictions affecting virtualisation – random blog","url":"https://threedots.ovh/blog/2020/12/macos-eula-licensing-restrictions-affecting-virtualisation/"},{"title":"Licensing policy for virtualization - Apple Community","url":"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7367745"},{"title":"Licensing policies for virtualization - Apple Community","url":"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5476987"},{"title":"macOS Big Sur adds ‘leasing’ terms that pull hosting services like Macstadium out of a legal gray area - 9to5Mac","url":"https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macos-big-sur-adds-leasing-terms-that-pull-hosting-services-like-macstadium-out-of-a-legal-gray-area/"},{"title":"Apple Legal - Legal - Software License Agreements - Apple","url":"https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/"},{"title":"macos - Does Apple's license for OS X allow it to be virtualized on an HP PC? - Ask Different","url":"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20965/does-apples-license-for-os-x-allow-it-to-be-virtualized-on-an-hp-pc"},{"title":"Developers, Big Sur, and Vindication","url":"https://www.macstadium.com/blog/developers-big-sur-and-vindication"},{"title":"Buy MAC VPS , Best&Cheap Macintosh Hosting 2025 | VPS SOS","url":"https://vpssos.com/best-cheap-mac-vps/"},{"title":"Virtualization | Apple Developer Documentation","url":"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about Apple macOS virtualization licensing EULA requirements for cloud hosting in 2025:\n\n## Key macOS Virtualization EULA Requirements\n\n### Hardware Restrictions\nThe OS X EULA does allow for OS X to be virtualized on Apple hardware as both host and guest.

Key features include:\n\n- **Availability**: Mac instances are available only as bare metal instances on Dedicated Hosts, with a minimum allocation period of 24 hours before you can release the Dedicated Host.\n- **Pricing**: AWS will charge $1.083 per hour, billed by the second. That's just under $26 to spin up a machine and run it for 24 hours.\n- **Instance Types**: Mac instances are available only as On-Demand Instances. They are not available as Spot Instances or Reserved Instances.\n- **CLI Support**: You can use a small shell script, like the one below, to poll the describe-instance-status API to know when the instance is ready to be connected to. In the following command, replace the example instance ID with your own. for i in $(seq 1 200); do aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids=i-1234567890abcdef0 \\ --query='InstanceStatuses[0].InstanceStatus.Status'; sleep 5; done;\n- **Launch Time**: For an AWS vended AMI with a x86 Mac instance or a Apple silicon Mac instance, the launch time can range from approximately 6 minutes to 20 minutes.\n\n### 2. **MacStadium**\nBuild faster with MacStadium's globally available, enterprise-grade Mac cloud solutions for CI/CD, Xcode, iOS builds, macOS testing, and more.\n\n- **Orka Platform**: Orka Platform orchestrates macOS in the cloud using Kubernetes technology on genuine Apple hardware. Built by developers for developers, Orka Platform is specifically designed for Mac and integrates with industry-leading tools to provide powerful scalability.\n- **AWS Integration**: Orka orchestrates up to 2 VMs per EC2 Mac, which means your development team can execute twice as many tasks with the same hardware pool.\n- **Pricing**: An M1-powered Mac mini with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage currently costs $109 or €109 per month on MacStadium\n- **Enterprise Features**: MacStadium has been a leader in the Mac cloud space for over a decade. We're proud to be a core part of the Apple developer ecosystem.\n\n### 3. **Scaleway**\nCloud hosting company Scaleway is adding a new type of instances today — Mac minis powered by Apple's M1 chip. The new instances cost €0.10 per hour, around $0.12 at today's rate — there's a minimum commitment of 24 hours.\n\n- **Hardware**: When you boot up a Mac mini from the console, you get an entry-level Mac mini with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD and macOS Big Sur. And of course, it uses Apple's first Arm-based chip, the M1.\n- **Access Methods**: After that, you can connect to the instance using VNC — you'll see the desktop environment and you'll be able to use it like a normal Mac. You can also connect to the instance using SSH directly in case you only need a command line interface.\n- **Pricing Comparison**: If you keep a Mac Mini instance for 30 days on Scaleway, it costs €72 (or $87 at today's rate).\n- **Data Center**: Scaleway is hosting those new computers in its DC4 data center in Paris — it's a former underground nuclear fallout shelter. Right now, the Mac minis aren't available in the company's other data centers in Amsterdam or Warsaw.\n\n## Other Providers Mentioned\nThere are also several Mac-focused hosting companies out there, such as MacStadium, MacinCloud, MacWeb and Mac Mini Vault.\n\n## Key Use Cases\nYou can use Mac servers for development purposes, and specifically for continuous integration and delivery. Building an iOS app requires a Mac. You can't just build the app on an Ubuntu server. So if you want to build your app on a server, you have to rent a Mac.\n\nAll three major providers (AWS EC2 Mac, MacStadium, and Scaleway) offer CLI/API support for automation and integration with CI/CD pipelines, making them suitable for developers who need programmatic access to Mac cloud infrastructure."}]},"uuid":"732a8ba3-4d34-43eb-b878-ced2a9ffc869","timestamp":"2025-08-31T10:18:46.154Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"MacStadium AWS EC2 Mac scaleway cloud mac hosting providers CLI API 2025","results":["I'll search for information about Mac cloud hosting providers with CLI/API support in 2025, including MacStadium, AWS EC2 Mac, and Scaleway.",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Viy1Mbncv4KuTzip93pwNQ","content":[{"title":"Amazon EC2 Mac Instances - Amazon Web Services","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/mac/"},{"title":"Amazon EC2 Mac instances - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-mac-instances.html"},{"title":"What you need to know about AWS's new EC2 Mac instances","url":"https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/cloud/what-you-need-to-know-about-awss-new-ec2-mac-instances"},{"title":"MacStadium | Mac Cloud Solutions on Apple Hardware","url":"https://www.macstadium.com/"},{"title":"Scaleway launches Mac mini cloud instances | TechCrunch","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/scaleway-launches-mac-mini-cloud-instances/"},{"title":"Europe's empowering cloud provider | Scaleway","url":"https://www.scaleway.com/en/"},{"title":"AWS brings the Mac mini to its cloud | TechCrunch","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/aws-brings-the-mac-mini-to-its-cloud/"},{"title":"AWS Marketplace: Orka platform by MacStadium","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xiycyb7mtmz6s"},{"title":"Orka on AWS EC2 Macs","url":"https://www.macstadium.com/orka-on-aws"},{"title":"Best MacStadium Alternatives & Competitors","url":"https://sourceforge.net/software/product/MacStadium/alternatives"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of Mac cloud hosting providers with CLI/API support in 2025:\n\n## Major Mac Cloud Hosting Providers\n\n### 1. **AWS EC2 Mac Instances**\nAmazon EC2 Mac instances are built on Mac mini computers and feature the macOS operating system.

In the following command, replace the example instance ID with your own. for i in $(seq 1 200); do aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids=i-1234567890abcdef0 \\ --query='InstanceStatuses[0].InstanceStatus.Status'; sleep 5; done;\n- **Launch Time**: For an AWS vended AMI with a x86 Mac instance or a Apple silicon Mac instance, the launch time can range from approximately 6 minutes to 20 minutes.\n\n### 2. **MacStadium**\nBuild faster with MacStadium's globally available, enterprise-grade Mac cloud solutions for CI/CD, Xcode, iOS builds, macOS testing, and more.\n\n- **Orka Platform**: Orka Platform orchestrates macOS in the cloud using Kubernetes technology on genuine Apple hardware. Built by developers for developers, Orka Platform is specifically designed for Mac and integrates with industry-leading tools to provide powerful scalability.\n- **AWS Integration**: Orka orchestrates up to 2 VMs per EC2 Mac, which means your development team can execute twice as many tasks with the same hardware pool.\n- **Pricing**: An M1-powered Mac mini with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage currently costs $109 or €109 per month on MacStadium\n- **Enterprise Features**: MacStadium has been a leader in the Mac cloud space for over a decade. We're proud to be a core part of the Apple developer ecosystem.\n\n### 3. **Scaleway**\nCloud hosting company Scaleway is adding a new type of instances today — Mac minis powered by Apple's M1 chip. The new instances cost €0.10 per hour, around $0.12 at today's rate — there's a minimum commitment of 24 hours.\n\n- **Hardware**: When you boot up a Mac mini from the console, you get an entry-level Mac mini with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD and macOS Big Sur. And of course, it uses Apple's first Arm-based chip, the M1.\n- **Access Methods**: After that, you can connect to the instance using VNC — you'll see the desktop environment and you'll be able to use it like a normal Mac. You can also connect to the instance using SSH directly in case you only need a command line interface.\n- **Pricing Comparison**: If you keep a Mac Mini instance for 30 days on Scaleway, it costs €72 (or $87 at today's rate).\n- **Data Center**: Scaleway is hosting those new computers in its DC4 data center in Paris — it's a former underground nuclear fallout shelter. Right now, the Mac minis aren't available in the company's other data centers in Amsterdam or Warsaw.\n\n## Other Providers Mentioned\nThere are also several Mac-focused hosting companies out there, such as MacStadium, MacinCloud, MacWeb and Mac Mini Vault.\n\n## Key Use Cases\nYou can use Mac servers for development purposes, and specifically for continuous integration and delivery. Building an iOS app requires a Mac. You can't just build the app on an Ubuntu server. So if you want to build your app on a server, you have to rent a Mac.\n\nAll three major providers (AWS EC2 Mac, MacStadium, and Scaleway) offer CLI/API support for automation and integration with CI/CD pipelines, making them suitable for developers who need programmatic access to Mac cloud infrastructure."],"durationSeconds":47.431061688999996}}
