        This template is designed for complex tasks that benefit from AI analysis and decomposition.
        The more detail you provide, the better the AI can break down and implement the task.

      description: What is the goal of this task?
      placeholder: |
        The objective is to implement a sophisticated caching system that:
        - Reduces API response times by 50%
        - Handles cache invalidation intelligently
        - Works across all framework variants (Core, Remix, Next.js)

      description: Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
      placeholder: |
        1. Cache API responses with configurable TTL
        2. Support multiple cache storage backends (memory, Redis, etc.)
        3. Implement cache warming strategies
        4. Add cache hit/miss metrics
        5. Ensure cache consistency across distributed systems

      placeholder: |
        - Must be compatible with existing middleware architecture
        - Should use TypeScript generics for type safety
        - Performance overhead should be < 5ms per request
        - Must support both server-side and client-side caching
