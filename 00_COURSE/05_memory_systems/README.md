# Memory Systems for Context Engineering

> "Memory is not like a container that gradually fills up; it is more like a tree that grows hooks onto which the memories are hung." — Peter Russell

Welcome to the Memory Systems module, where we explore how to create sophisticated memory architectures that persist, evolve, and adapt across multiple interactions. This module moves beyond simple conversation history to implement brain-inspired memory systems that truly learn and grow.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

1. **Memory Architectures**: Different approaches to persistent memory in AI systems
2. **Attractor Dynamics**: How stable memory patterns form and evolve in neural fields
3. **Reconstructive Memory**: Brain-inspired memory systems that assemble rather than retrieve
4. **Memory Management**: Strategies for handling token limits and memory optimization
5. **Persistent Agents**: Creating agents that maintain coherent memory across sessions
