### 💎 ETD (Engineering Time Diverted) Economic Model

The revolutionary economic foundation of the supercompute ecosystem:

#### **🏦 Stablecoin Backing Mechanism**
- **Real Value Anchor**: Each token backed by measurable engineering hours saved
- **zkML Proof System**: Cryptographic validation of productivity improvements on EXPchain
- **Compound Growth**: Network effects multiply value as adoption increases
- **Stability Guarantee**: Productivity-backed currency resistant to speculative volatility

#### **📊 Value Generation Metrics**
```python
# ETD Economic Calculation Framework
class ETDEconomicModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_engineer_rate = 150  # USD per hour
        self.quantum_multiplier = 15   # Average acceleration factor
        self.network_effect = 1.2     # Network scaling benefit
        
    def calculate_token_value(self, hours_saved, network_size):
        base_value = hours_saved * self.base_engineer_rate
        acceleration_value = base_value * self.quantum_multiplier
        network_premium = acceleration_value * (network_size ** 0.1)
        return network_premium
        
    def total_backing_potential(self):
        # Australia: 180,000 engineers × 15x × 2000 hours/year × $150
        australia_backing = 180000 * 15 * 2000 * 150
        return australia_backing  # $810 billion annually
```
