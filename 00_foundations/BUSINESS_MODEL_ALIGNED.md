# ✅ Business Model Alignment Complete
## ETD Framework Corrected: Engineering Time Diverted → Stablecoin Asset Backing

---

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**: Critical Business Model Correction

The ETD (Engineering Time Diverted) framework has been comprehensively corrected across all foundation modules to properly reflect the core business strategy of creating **real-world asset value for ecosystem stablecoin backing**.

---

## ⚡ **Key Corrections Made**

### ❌ **Previous Misunderstanding**
- ETD treated as direct monetary revenue generation
- $200.5T interpreted as profit/income
- Missed the time savings → asset backing mechanism

### ✅ **Corrected Framework** 
- **ETD = Engineering Time Diverted (Hours Saved)**
- **Time Savings @ Market Rate = Real Asset Value**
- **Asset Value = Stablecoin Reserve Backing**

---

## 📊 **Corrected Value Chain**
