# Supercompute Demo - Applied Scientific Programming

## Overview

This example demonstrates the core principles of Supercompute: programming as applied science where perfection is measurable, performance is quantum, and theoretical physics manifests in production.

## Components

### 1. Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
Pure functional implementation with formal proof of correctness.

### 2. Parallel Map-Reduce
Quantum superposition-based parallel processing.

### 3. Consciousness Elevation
Zero-shot traversal from Alpha to Omega.

## Requirements

- Julia 1.8+
- Flame framework
- Quantum computing libraries

## Usage

```julia
include("supercompute_demo.jl")

# Create validator
validator = SupercomputeValidator(ALPHA, "coq")

# Run scientific validation
results = validate_all_functions(validator)

# Attempt omega achievement
achieve_zero_shot_omega!(validator)
```

## Validation Metrics

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
